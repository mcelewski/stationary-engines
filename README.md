# Project Info

## Title
**Mega** (working title)

## Genre
Arcade game kept in 90's / retro theme

## Team members
Just me

## Short descripton
Simple 2D arcade game where player flies a spaceship and avoids (or destroys) other ships coming from across the map (nothing complicated really...)
<br />
<br />
At the beginning of a gameplay player has 5 lives. He / she loses 1 life if there's some collision between vehicles or his / her vehicle is hit by a laser from incoming spaceships. Player can see it not only by a health bar but also by how spaceship is damaged. Game isn't over until player loses all lives.

Even though **WipEout 2048** / **WipEout Omega Collection** is 3D video racing game, it also inspired me to think about this project (and actually reminded about **Galaga**)<br />

## To-do list
- [ ] Create spaceship, surprise boxes (something like "question mark" block in **Super Mario Bros.**) and background graphics - *late December*
- [ ] Create UI (including menu, gameplay background animation and elements such as health bar, score counter and so on) - *late December*
- [ ] Create in-game sound effects (such as ship's engine, surprise boxes and so on) - *late December*
- [ ] Create simple spaceship steering (moving left, right, up and down + shooting laser) - *late December*
- [ ] Create surprise boxes actions (such as setting time speed to 2.0x, changing steering by swapping keys *A* / *left arrow* and *D* / *right arrow* with each other and so on) - *early January*
- [ ] ~~Take deep breaths~~
- [ ] Check, correct and prepare final, complete, **_working (!!!)_** code files for specific game components (entire game must be running ofc) - *early January*

## It-can-be-included-but-it-is-not-necessary list
- [ ] Create 2 or 3 music tracks to the game (kept in Retrowave / Synthwave genre) rather than downloading them from the Internet - *after doing everything important in **To-do list***
- [ ] Create some "boss-like" fight that appears after every 100000 points - *after doing everything important in **To-do list***

If I come up with some other ideas or realize that there's something missing, I'll add it to the list

## Work in progress
- [x] [Create spaceship graphics](https://github.com/mcelewski/stationary-engines/blob/master/Models/spaceships_models.png)
- [x] [Create spaceship collision effects](https://github.com/mcelewski/stationary-engines/blob/master/Models/player_spaceship_collision_effects.png)
